## Get started
When you first launch the application, you must enable it by clicking on the **"Enabled"** button, and the application will start working in the background. That's it!<br>
You can also choose the frequency of changing the wallpaper and choose whether it is necessary to change the wallpaper only when connected to a WiFi network. <br>
If you are impatient and you want to change the wallpaper right now, click on the **"Next"** button, wait for the image to load, and then click on it to set it as a background!

Checkboxes:
- **Enabled**: enabling / disabling the wallpaper change
- **Mobile screen resolution only**: search for images with mobile screen resolution only
- **WiFi only**: download new wallpapers only via WiFi

Radio buttons allow you to choose the frequency of changing the wallpaper:
- **Once a day**: the wallpaper will change shortly after 00:00 of the next day
- **Once a week**: the wallpaper will change shortly after 00:00 on Sunday or Monday (it depends on your system settings) of the next week
- **Once a month**: the wallpaper will change shortly after 00:00 on the 1st of the next month

Buttons:
- **Cancel**: resetting all changes after the **"Edit"** button. After that, you need to click on the image to set it as the background
- **Edit**: allows you to crop the image if it is too large. After editing the image, you need to click it again to set it as the background
- **Next**: download a new image right now. To set new image as a background just click on it

**Image**: wallpaper preview. Click on it to set it as the background!

**Link under the image**: after successfully downloading the image, a link will appear under it leading to page on http://mylittlewallpaper.com, where you can download this image

You can also change the theme of the application! There are currently 5 themes available: three light and two dark. Available in "_3 vertical dots_" menu.

_Notice for Android 8 users and higher_: due to the new system policy, starting from Android 8 and higher, for the correct operation of this app, constant display of notification is required.<br>
So you can't disable the notification without disabling the wallpaper change.
